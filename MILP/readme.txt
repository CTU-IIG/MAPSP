This model solves Multi-Agent Project Scheduling Problem. The objective is
to find a Nash equilibrya which minimizes Cmax.

The details about this method can be found in:

Briand C. - Ngueveu, S.U. - Šùcha, P. Finding an optimal Nash equilibrium to the multi-agent
project scheduling problem In: Journal of Scheduling. Under review. 2015. 

The MILP model is implemented in IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio, version 12.6.3.0.
